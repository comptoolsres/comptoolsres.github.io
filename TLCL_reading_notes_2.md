{% include note.html content="These two chapters cover a fair bit. **Do not** attempt to memorize everything. There is a lot of great information here, hopefully you will remember some of it.
<br><br>
My goal in having you read these chapters is for you to get a deeper understanding of Linux and see some of the amazing tools at your disposal. I use the command line daily, and don't have most of this memorized...
<br><br>
Think of it as a tour of the toolbox: you don't need to know how to use every tool, and probably don't have a good idea what you would ever do with many of the tools, but someday down the road, you will either remember that there is a tool to do what you need, or say to yourself, the way I am doing this is a pain, let me go back to the toolbox and see if there is a better way." %}

## Ch 7: Seeing the World as the Shell Sees It

* This chapter covers a lot. It is definitely worth reading and doing your best to understand, but can get a little on the overly detailed side.
* p. 71: **Arithmetic Expansion**: One thing that this section should point out to you is that, while you *can* do math with bash, it is not the easiest thing! Especially with more complex calculations, bash quickly becomes more trouble than it is worth and it is far easier to switch to Python or other language with better math functionality.
* p. 75: **Backquotes**: The text uses the term "backquote" for the '`' character (usually the key to the left of the 1 on your keyboard), this character is also referred to as the "backtick".

## Ch 8: Advanced Keyboard Tricks

* This chapter can certainly improve your skills and make it easier to do things, but I would not spend time worrying trying to memorize these. It is helpful to know that the options exist, and find and remember the ones you find helpful, but memorizing these is not the goal.
* p. 83: **Completion**: Tab completion is definitely worth learning, you will use it all the time!
* p. 85: **Using History**: While history is maintained on HiPerGator and is very useful, please be aware that because you can be logged in on multiple servers, sometimes things get lost in the history. It will generally be there and can be used, but don't rely on exclusively. Keep notes of useful commands, etc.
