## What is git

Git is a tool for version tracking that has become increasingly popular among coders for facilitating not only version tracking, but also collaboration and code distribution.

You do not need to have git installed on your own computer, but you may want to. It is freely available from: [https://git-scm.com/](https://git-scm.com/).

## What is github.com

[github.com](github.com) is a service that allows you to host git repositories (sets of files being tracked by git) on a publicly accessible website, further promoting collaboration, sharing, and code distribution. Many applications, data, and more are distributed via github.com and we will use github.com to explore using git for version control and collaboration. Indeed, the page you are reading now is part of a git repository hosted at github.com!

## Register for your github.com account

* Go to [github.com](github.com) and sign-up for an account--please use your @ufl.edu email address when signing up. This will allow you to get an academic account.

  {% include note.html content="github.com frequently updates their pricing model. The free account currently has all the features you will need, so it is not as important as it used to be to register with a @ufl.edu email.<br>
  Non-UF students can use whatever email is best for them" %} 

* On the second page, select a free account.

  {% include note.html content="You should never need to pay anything or enter any credit card information!" %}

* An email should now have been sent to you. Verify your email address by clicking the link in the email.

* **This is optional**: To add the educational upgrade to a pro account, you can go to https://education.github.com and follow the steps to request an educational discount.
