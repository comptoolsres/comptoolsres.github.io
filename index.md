## About this site

This site is the being developed as the main repository for Matt Gitzendanner's Computational Tools for Research in Biology. This course is offered every-other-year at the [University of Florida](https://ufl.edu). My hope is that this site can serve both as the primary resource when teaching the course, and as a resource for others teaching similar courses or learning on their own.

The course is designed to be a one semester, 3-credit course for upper-level undergraduate and starting graduate students.

## Course Description

{% include image.html file='comptools.png' alt="Image of servers and tool icons" position="right" %}

Information technology has dramatically transformed how research across many disciplines is conducted. This is particularly true in the biological sciences where researchers frequently find themselves faced with massive amounts of diverse data to analyze. As data types and volumes continue to grow, knowledge of scripting, database management, and advanced computing skills are critical for researchers.

Topics covered in the course will address a gap in how research has advanced—*and become increasingly computational*— while student training in the use of computational tools has lagged. The course will cover basic concepts that will provide the ability for students to apply new technologies to a wide array of research questions. A foundation in data management and analysis concepts opens doors for well-trained scientists and allows them to work in multidisciplinary research.

This course will survey areas where high performance computing, large-scale data access and integration, informatics tools and software, and multi-disciplinary collaboration have had high impact on research as a foundation for computationally-enabled research.

## Course organization

The course is divided into three main sections:

### Section 1

* Linux command line
* Bash scripting
* Version control
* Using high-performance computing resources

### Section 2

* Python scripting

### Section 3

* SQL database introduction and integration with Python



## Course Objectives

* Demonstrate how technology infrastructure can improve research and open new avenues of investigation.
* Competently navigate the Unix/Linux command line interface.
* Effectively and efficiently manipulate text files, performing complex regular expression replacements, reformatting and merging files in various ways.
* Raise and address current issues through class participation and discussion.
* Use High Performance Computing resources such as the UF Research Computing for cluster-based analyses. Including batch scripting and running multi-processor applications (threaded and MPI).
* Explain the basic anatomy of computer scripts/programs, with particular focus on Python scripting.
* Construct analytical pipelines to accomplish complex tasks.
* Describe basic database design, creation and manipulation. Perform scripted database operations for information discovery, data exploration and research data curation.
* Have a basic understanding of research graphics formats, preparation and manipulation

## Meeting Times

Summer A runs May 11, 2020 through June 19, 2020.

May 25th is Memorial Day holiday.

### Synchronous meetings: Mon ,Wed,Fri

* I will be online and presenting material and/or helping students: **Mon, Wed, Fri during 3rd period (11:00am - 12:15pm)**
  * You should make every effort to attend these sessions. While there will be note pages and hopefully a video recording of these sessions, **this is the best opportunity to ask questions and get help from me and others in the class.**
  * I understand that with all that is going on, some students will need to miss classes sometimes. That is fine and I will do my best to help you catch up, but regular attendance is the best way to learn.

### Asynchronous meetings: Tue, Thurs

* On Tuesday and Thursday, students will work on projects either independently or in groups.
* These sessions can be more flexible in timing and will give you and your classmates times to get more hands-on experience and challenge yourselves to learn on your own.
* There will still be content that needs to be covered, and students should plan on working on Tuesday and Thursday, but can generally do the work whenever is convenient for them.

### Office hours: Thursday and by appointment

* I have scheduled office hours for **Thursday between 11:00am and 2:00pm**. I am also available at other times by appointment.
* Coding is not always easy. Simple solutions are not always obvious. There will be some frustration. I expect that you will need help--that is why I teach this course! I want to help you! I cannot always help if you don't ask. Please ask for help.

## Course textbooks

The main texts for the course are:

* The Linux Command Line: http://linuxcommand.org
* Python For Everyone: https://www.py4e.com

Each of these is available as a free PDF download or for purchase in print.
